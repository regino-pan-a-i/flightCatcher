# Overview

In order to get more acquainted with the Java programming language I studied and developed the following project, furthering my knowledge on a new language.

This program uses an API that provides realtime flight information, this way the user can serach by flight, airline, or city and receive the status of specific flights.

By creating this project I inteded to practice with the use of a wide viriety of Java commands ranging from simple print and input statements to decisions, loops, methods, classes, and third party libraries and resources.

# Development Environment

I used Java JDK, Visual Studio Code, Github, Chat GPT, and FlightLabs to develop my project.

Within the Java language I had to download the json-simple.jar library to access the information provided by the API, java.util for basic methods such as arrays and scanner, and java.net.HttpURLConnection to stablish connecition to an outside server.

# Future Work

Pending things:

- Complete the citySearch method to ask for departing or arriving city, and create API request 
- Final touches on print methods to personalize based on the search
- Fix access to deeply-indented values within the JSON array for easy display 
- Create a list of posible cities and airlines for the user to search, saving on a hashMap their Iata code in order to use in search
